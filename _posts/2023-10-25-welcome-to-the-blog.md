I've been meaning to get a website deployed for over a year. At work, I've been starting to write more complex code, and I am going to start using _git_ for version control. I used _GitHub_ in college for my [senior thesis](https://github.com/mmccoy-01/RTI). At the time I knew it was for documenting code and that it was good coding practice from what I've read about. During my senior year, around the same time, if not earlier, I had migrated from Notion to Obsidian for notetaking. Obsidian is where I learned more about md language, YAML, and SQL. Simple, elegant, and powerful documentation. No frills, no distractions. I wanted to be a part of creating meaningful and polished content.

Now, this site is using GitHub pages for static hosting and powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for rendering simple md files into html (like the one you're reading now).
